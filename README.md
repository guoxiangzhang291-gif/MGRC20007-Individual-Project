# MGRC20007-Individual-Project
Individual project for MGRC20007: SVC model for bank customer churn prediction.
Project Overview
This repository contains the complete implementation for the individual extension of the MGRC20007 group churn-prediction project.  
The objective of this individual project is to build an improved churn-prediction model using **Support Vector Classification (SVC) with enhanced recall, improved fairness metrics, and stronger business value estimation.
